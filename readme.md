myAddressBook
=============

**myAddressBook** is an _address book_ HTML5 app, developed as a sample application for developers which want to learn how to:

 * Develop single page applications with Angular, AngularJS or React.
 * Use Bootstrap for create user interfaces.
 * Use PouchDB for client-side storage.

[Live demo](http://jfmdev.github.io/myAddressBook/redux/ "myAddressBook - Live demo")

> Note that in this branch uses React (with Redux) as JavaScript framework.  
> But they are other branches that use [React (without Redux)](https://github.com/jfmdev/ngAddressBook/tree/react), [Angular](https://github.com/jfmdev/ngAddressBook/tree/angular), [Angular with ngrx](https://github.com/jfmdev/ngAddressBook/tree/ngrx) and [AngularJS](https://github.com/jfmdev/ngAddressBook/tree/angularjs).

Features
--------

The application is very simple: it shows a list of contacts that can be updated, using a form, or downloaded as a CSV file.

When the application is opened, shows a list of all contacts;
each contact as an "Edit" button which opens a form, in which the user can modify
or delete the contact. Below the list of contacts, they are two buttons, one for add new contacts and another for export the current list as a CSV file.

Browser support
---------------

Since this application makes use of React, Bootstrap and PouchDB, browser support is restrained to browsers supported by these three technologies (i.e. it should work fine on any modern browser).
